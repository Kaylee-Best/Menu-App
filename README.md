# MenuApp
For this project I modified the menu app done for lab 5. This app just displayed the items stored in an array onto the screen for the user to view.
I added 2 new components for the application. I created a checkout calculator that adds up the totals of the selected prices on the menu
and I create a component that allows the user to add a new item to the menu.
